## This folder includes the Supplementary Files related to the publication

- _SupplementaryFileS1_ contains the raw data of turtle measurements and literature information about the original study providing body size and/or limb measurements
- _SupplementaryFileS2_ contains the complete set of PGLS regression results for turtle allometric relationships, both at the global level but also the clade-specific results
- _SupplementaryFileS3_ contains additional text on the clade-specific regression results with embedded figures that identify individual datapoints in the regression scatterplots shown in the main publication
- _SupplementaryFileS4_ contains body size predictions for all of the fossil specimens with unknown straight carapace length included in our study

## The folder also includes Supplementary Figures

- _1_LIMBS_suppl_plot _ refers to Figure 1 in the Main Text, but with individual datapoints labelled as numbers for identification of individual taxa. This figure compares log10-transformed femur length (y-axis) versus log10-transformed humerus length (x-axis).
- _2_HUM_suppl_plot _ refers to Figure 1 in the Main Text, but with individual datapoints labelled as numbers for identification of individual taxa. This figure compares log10-transformed straight carapace length (y-axis) versus log10-transformed humerus length (x-axis).
- _3_FEM_suppl_plot _ refers to Figure 1 in the Main Text, but with individual datapoints labelled as numbers for identification of individual taxa. This figure compares log10-transformed straight carapace length (y-axis) versus log10-transformed femur length (x-axis).
