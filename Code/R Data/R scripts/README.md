## The following `R` scripts were used in the publication:

- 1) `script_size.R` reads the raw data and filters the data to only include the adult specimens in our sample (see Main Text for explanation), and prunes the turtle phylogenetic tree to match the taxa in each subset used for downstream analyses
- 2) `pgls_runs.R` executes PGLS analyses on the global and clade-specific subsets of our data and runs the predictions for fossil specimens with unknown straight carapace lengths
- 3) `residuals.R` extracts both global and clade-specific residual values from PGLS regressions that will be used at a later point for visual purposes (see e.g., Figures 1-3 in the Main Text)
- 4) `slope_differences.R` compare the purely allometric slopes of PGLS and OLS regressions of our global datasets. This is a modified code based on Paiva et al. (2023)
- 5) `comparisons_sigma.R` reads the raw data from additional amniote allometric datasets (see 'Datasets' folder) and phylogenetic trees related to these datasets and executes PGLS regressions of body size vs. humerus/femur size and femur vs. humerus size as a means to compare the sigma2 values of these allometric relationships with the values of turtle allometries
- 6) `script_plot_final.R` contains the code to reproduce the figures shown in the Main Text and also in Supplementary File S2. These figures were exported in `pdf` format and later edited (i.e., inclusion of silhouettes, removal of unnecessary blank space etc) in Adobe Illustrator
