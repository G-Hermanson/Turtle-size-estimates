## This folder includes:

- "Datasets": raw data in `csv` format of different amniote allometric datasets, obtained from the following studies: Campione and Evans ([2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1741-7007-10-60)), Field et al. ([2013](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0082000)), Benson et al. ([2018](https://doi.org/10.1111/pala.12329)), Iijima et al. ([2018](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.171774)) and Panciroli et al. ([2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07733-1)) 
- "Tree files": phylogenetic tree filespruned to the dataset samples of the abovementioned studies, and that were used in PGLS regressions to extract the sigma2 values for comparisons with turtles. This folder also contains the phylogenetic tree of turtles (_Sterli_MCCT.tre_) used in the turtle PGLS regression analyses. This was obtained from Farina et al. ([2023](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10201))
- "R scripts": self-explanatory, but this folder contains the `R` scripts we used in the study for the various analyses and plots shown in the publication
